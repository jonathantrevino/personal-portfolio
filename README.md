I'm Jonathan Trevino (often called JT), a software engineer in web development. Currently building [https://www.webportfolios.dev](https://www.webportfolios.dev).

I really like the ability to create a personal website like this developer portfolio and have had many portfolios that I've built in the past, always making sure the next is more refined.

If you need help with your portfolio, don't feel shy to ask, will help any way that I can!
